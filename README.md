# Project:
WholesaleSaga: Single window solution for all your wholesale needs 


## MISSION:
To revolutionise the way businesses source their products. We aim to create a seamless platform where suppliers and buyers can connect effortlessly, facilitating a dynamic marketplace that fosters growth and success for all parties involved.

## PROBLEM:
The problem I observed was the lack of accessibility and convenience in the wholesale market. As an individual looking to purchase goods in bulk for various purposes, I found it daunting to navigate through scattered suppliers and disparate platforms. This fragmented landscape often resulted in time-consuming searches, inconsistent product quality, and difficulties in negotiating prices. Recognizing the need for a user-friendly solution, I embarked on creating a wholesale market website.
